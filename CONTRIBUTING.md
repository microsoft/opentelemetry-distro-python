## Before You Start

- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Open an issue before starting large changes so the scope and direction can be discussed.
- Keep changes focused and include tests when behavior changes.

## Development Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install tox and the development dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
python -m pip install -e .[dev] tox
```

## Running Checks with Tox

Run all environments at once or pick individual ones.

```bash
# Run everything (pylint, mypy, black, tests on Python 3.10-3.14)
tox

# Run a single check
tox -e pylint       # Lint with pylint
tox -e mypy         # Type-check with mypy
tox -e black        # Format with black

# Run tests on a specific Python version
tox -e pytest-py312

# Run tests on multiple Python versions
tox -e pytest-py310,pytest-py311,pytest-py312,pytest-py313,pytest-py314

# Pass extra arguments to pytest
tox -e pytest-py312 -- -k test_name -v
```

## Pull Requests

- Describe the problem and the approach clearly.
- Link related issues when applicable.
- Update documentation when public behavior or setup changes.
- Keep the repository planning and README documents aligned with the implementation.
